# Railwind

Tailwind compiler rewritten in Rust

## Description

The main goal, is to decouple the original Tailwind project from Node and NPM with the side goal of possibly making it even faster and smaller (Tailwind already has a [standalone version](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli), but the binary size is a *whooping 35 mb*).

# Features

Currently, not all Tailwind features are supported. At the moment, the following features are working:

### Layout
- [x] Container
- [x] Aspect ratio

### Spacing
- [x] Padding
- [x] Margin

### Flexbox & Grid
- [x] Flex

### Other
- [x] Pseudo-classes
- [x] Pseudo-elements
- [x] Media queries
