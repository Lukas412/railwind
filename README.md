<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Tailwind parser implemented in Rust. The main goal, is to decouple the original Tailwind project from Node and NPM with the side goal of possibly making it even faster and smaller (Tailwind already has a [standalone version](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli), but the binary size is a *whooping 35 mb*).
